# SQL-challenge

# Overview of the Project 

Acting as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard I was assignmed to do a research project about people employed at the company during the 1980s and 1990s from CSV files containing employee data. I imported the CSV files into an SQL database and used data modelling, data engineering and data analysis techniques to report my findings.
